## The Program [Knowledge and Application]

### Level 1 Requirements
- [ ] Create a character that jumps when the user provides some input.
- [ ] Character should stop moving when it hits the “ground”.

### Level 2 Requirements
- [ ] Create obstacles that the character can not pass through (or otherwise interacts with).  (Hint: You are already doing this for the ground, extrapolate this to a smaller “edge” anywhere on the screen.)
- [ ] Change one or more key parameters of the character’s movement with user input.

### Level 3 Requirements
- [ ] Turn the program into a simple mini-game.
- [ ] The program has a clearly defined start screen.
- [ ] The program provides the user with instructions on how to play **inside** the program.
- [ ] The program has an end condition and appropriate end screen.

### Level 4 Requirements
- [ ] Program should have some elements of randomness for replayability.
- [ ] Extra features and improvements added to the program.
- [ ] Program is well polished visually.
- [ ] Program is well polished within the code.
  - [ ] Bugs exist in the program
  - [ ] Significant amount of code duplication
  - [ ] Code is very inefficient
  - [ ] Coding decisions are poorly implemented
  - [ ] Other -
